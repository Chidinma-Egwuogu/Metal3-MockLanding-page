# Metal3-MockLanding-page
This is my Github repository with the code for the Metal3 landing page task. I used a lot of online resources here and went through Youtube videos like they were packs of cookies. When I started the Metal3 project, I didn't meet all the skills listed, and I was mildly surprised that I scaled through the first stage.

It didn't get easier when I heard that the second contribution required us to code in HTML and CSS. I have limited knowledge of these languages since I am predominantly a writer, so I was a little worried. But I gave it a shot and here we are. 

I tried to focus on the content of this landing page without making it too bulky for non-technical and technical audiences. And hopefully, I explained what Metal3 meant without boring people too. I love adding humour to my content too; you'll definitely find that here.

Thank you Metal3 for helping me learn a new skill.
